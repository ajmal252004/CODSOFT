# Task 1: Student Grade Calculator
A Java program that calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade of a student based on the marks obtained in each subject. This project helps students calculate their grades and track their performance. The program prompts the user to enter their marks in each subject, then calculates the total marks and average percentage. It also determines the grade based on a predefined grading scale. The program provides a user-friendly interface to input and view the results.

# Task 2: ATM Interface
A Java program that simulates a bank's automated teller machine (ATM), allowing users to perform transactions such as withdrawing cash, depositing money, and checking their balance. This project demonstrates the concept of user interaction and data validation. The program prompts the user to enter their account number and PIN, then provides options to perform various transactions. The program validates user input to ensure accurate processing of transactions and displays error messages for invalid inputs. The program also keeps track of the user's account balance and transaction history.

# Task 3: Student Management System
A Java program that manages a collection of students, allowing users to add, remove, search, and display student information. This project showcases data storage and retrieval concepts using files or databases. The program provides options to add new students, update existing student information, search for specific students, and display all students. The program stores student data in a file or database and allows for sorting and filtering of data based on various criteria such as name, ID, or grade level. The program also includes error handling to ensure data integrity and security.
